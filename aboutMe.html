						<strong>I</strong> am currently a sophmore at The Ohio State University majoring in computer and information science.
						I'm originally from Webster New York but am now living in Columbus Ohio to attend college.
						All over the news are stories about how large corporations are held hostage by hackers, data breaches caused private information to be exposed, and how even the government is spying on
						us and stealing our data.
						<br>

						Despite these events the world continues to become increasingly digitized and dependent on technology. This means the need to secure the nationâ€™s technological infrastructure and protect our
						online assets is ever growing.

						Another thing that has been all over the news has been developments in artificial intelligence. A lot of people are threatened by AI from popular media and a misunderstanding of its role.
						I am excited to learn more about the advantages and some of the dangers associated with artificial intelligence so I can possibly develop or use it in the future.

						Another area I am interested in is game development. I
						spent the summer of 2021 teaching myself how to use unity and have been experimenting with 2D top down games as well as virtual reality.
						I have recently been getting into cyber security. I have been playing with parrot security (similar to Kali Linux) and am really enjoying it.

						In all honesty
						all aspects of computer science fascinate me and its the reason I am focusing my life on it.
